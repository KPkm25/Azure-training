Create a VM Scaleset
---
1. Create a VM and install a single paged application(SPA) on it like Apache.
2. When the VM is running, capture an image with all the required configuration and delete the VM.
3. Go to VM Scale Set(VMSS) and select the resource group, location and the previously saved image.
4. A VNET was created automatically with the VM, select it in the networking tab.
5. Edit the VNET to create 2 subnets, one public and one private.
6. Add the private subnet to the network interface.
7. Create a Load Balancer and retain the default configuration for load balancing,i.e,
- **Frontend IP**: Public IP
- **Frontend port**: 80
- **Backend pool**: Your VMSS pool
- **Backend port**: 80
- **Probe**: Linked to your health probe
8. Now, the scale set has been created and a public IP address is available, which is the public IP for the load balancer and the project can be accessed on this IP. 

Important stuff:
- **Frontend IP**: Public IP
- **Frontend port**: 80
- **Backend pool**: Your VMSS pool
- **Backend port**: 80
- **Probe**: Linked to your health probe
frontend traffic (e.g., port 80) to the backend pool, nat rules
