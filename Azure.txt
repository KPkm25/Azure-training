Router: Forwards traffic between different networks.

Gateway: Entry/exit point of a network (think of it as a router + firewall).

Bridge: Connects two network segments and makes them act as one.


Types of Scaling in Kubernetes

-> Horizontal scaling/Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): This feature can effortlessly add or release pod replicas automatically.
-> Vertical scaling/Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA): This feature in which CPU and memory reservations adjust automatically.
-> Cluster Autoscaler: In this feature an analysis of resources occurs, and we make essential adjustments in the deployment and handle the load.(similar to horizontal scaling)

PaaS - Any service that can be customizable for the user

Non-functional requirements:

Non-functional requirements in software engineering refer to the characteristics of a software system that are not related to specific functionality or behavior. They describe how the system should perform, rather than what it should do. 

Examples of NFR:
-> Availability, scalability, performance, agility, security, consistency, reliability, durability

* Strategy is a long term plan while tactics are the short term plan to achieve a certain outcome

SaaS:

Characteristics:
-> Web based access
-> Centralised hosting
-> Subscription based pricing

Benefits:
-> Lower upfront cost
-> Reduced IT Overhead
-> Faster implementation
-> Automatic updates and maintenance
-> Scalability and Flexibility
-> Accessibility
-> Predictable costs

Cloud Deployment Models:

-> Public: Shared resources, Minimal Investment,No setup cost,Infrastructure Management is not required,No maintenance, Dynamic Scalability,Less secure

-> Private: Better Control,Data Security and Privacy,Supports Legacy Systems,Customization,Less scalable,Costly

-> Hybrid: Flexibility and control,Cost,Security,Difficult to manage,Slow data transmission

VNET:
A Virtual Network (VNET) in Azure is a private, isolated network environment where you can securely run your virtual machines, containers, databases, and services.
It’s basically your own custom network inside the cloud, similar to a traditional on-premises network — but fully virtual.

When you create a VNET, you must define an IP address space using CIDR notation (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).

This IP space is then divided into subnets (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24).

Resources like VMs and containers are assigned IPs from these subnets.
VNETs in the same or different regions can be connected via VNET Peering.

┌────────────┐
│   VNET     │  ← Your cloud-based private network (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)
│            │
│ ┌────────┐ │
│ │Subnet1 │ ← E.g., 10.0.1.0/24 – Public subnet
│ │  VM1   │
│ └────────┘ │
│ ┌────────┐ │
│ │Subnet2 │ ← E.g., 10.0.2.0/24 – Private subnet
│ │  VM2   │
│ └────────┘ │
└────────────┘

VPC/VNET peering (advantage and uses)->security, latency and cost


Bastion Host:

A Bastion Host is a highly secure virtual machine that acts as a gateway to access private resources (like VMs in a private subnet) without exposing them to the public internet.

A bastion host is a dedicated server designed to withstand cyberattacks and provide secure access to a private network from an untrusted source, such as the Internet.

It’s your "single door" into a secure network.

Internet
   ↓
[Bastion Host] ← Public Subnet, has public IP
   ↓
[Private VM] ← Private Subnet, no public IP


public/private subnets -> VNET -> availability zones -> subnets

Connecting to the Azure VM
-> Start the Cloud shell and upload the .pem file
-> Check the .pem file permissions by running the command ls -ltr
-> Change the file permission by running the cmd, "chmod 400 <pem file name>"
-> Connect to the instance via ssh using the command, "ssh -i <pem filename> <username>@<publicIP>", example: ssh -i parakram-vm01_key.pem parakram@74.224.99.200

VNETS are region scoped

VM must be in a Subnet, which belongs to a VNET, which is in a Region, optionally inside an Availability Zone.
