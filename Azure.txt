Router: Forwards traffic between different networks.

Gateway: Entry/exit point of a network (think of it as a router + firewall).

Bridge: Connects two network segments and makes them act as one.


Types of Scaling in Kubernetes

-> Horizontal scaling/Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): This feature can effortlessly add or release pod replicas automatically.
-> Vertical scaling/Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA): This feature in which CPU and memory reservations adjust automatically.
-> Cluster Autoscaler: In this feature an analysis of resources occurs, and we make essential adjustments in the deployment and handle the load.(similar to horizontal scaling)

PaaS - Any service that can be customizable for the user

Non-functional requirements:

Non-functional requirements in software engineering refer to the characteristics of a software system that are not related to specific functionality or behavior. They describe how the system should perform, rather than what it should do. 

Examples of NFR:
-> Availability, scalability, performance, agility, security, consistency, reliability, durability

* Strategy is a long term plan while tactics are the short term plan to achieve a certain outcome

SaaS:

Characteristics:
-> Web based access
-> Centralised hosting
-> Subscription based pricing

Benefits:
-> Lower upfront cost
-> Reduced IT Overhead
-> Faster implementation
-> Automatic updates and maintenance
-> Scalability and Flexibility
-> Accessibility
-> Predictable costs



VNET:
A Virtual Network (VNET) in Azure is a private, isolated network environment where you can securely run your virtual machines, containers, databases, and services.
It’s basically your own custom network inside the cloud, similar to a traditional on-premises network — but fully virtual.

When you create a VNET, you must define an IP address space using CIDR notation (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).

This IP space is then divided into subnets (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24).

Resources like VMs and containers are assigned IPs from these subnets.
VNETs in the same or different regions can be connected via VNET Peering.

┌────────────┐
│   VNET     │  ← Your cloud-based private network (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)
│            │
│ ┌────────┐ │
│ │Subnet1 │ ← E.g., 10.0.1.0/24 – Public subnet
│ │  VM1   │
│ └────────┘ │
│ ┌────────┐ │
│ │Subnet2 │ ← E.g., 10.0.2.0/24 – Private subnet
│ │  VM2   │
│ └────────┘ │
└────────────┘

VPC/VNET peering (advantage and uses)->security, latency and cost


Bastion Host:

A Bastion Host is a highly secure virtual machine that acts as a gateway to access private resources (like VMs in a private subnet) without exposing them to the public internet.

A bastion host is a dedicated server designed to withstand cyberattacks and provide secure access to a private network from an untrusted source, such as the Internet.

It’s your "single door" into a secure network.

Internet
   ↓
[Bastion Host] ← Public Subnet, has public IP
   ↓
[Private VM] ← Private Subnet, no public IP


public/private subnets -> VNET -> availability zones -> subnets

Connecting to the Azure VM
-> Start the Cloud shell and upload the .pem file
-> Check the .pem file permissions by running the command ls -ltr
-> Change the file permission by running the cmd, "chmod 400 <pem file name>"
-> Connect to the instance via ssh using the command, "ssh -i <pem filename> <username>@<publicIP>", example: ssh -i parakram-vm01_key.pem parakram@74.224.99.200

VNETS are region scoped

VM must be in a Subnet, which belongs to a VNET, which is in a Region, optionally inside an Availability Zone.


Creating subnets

n/w	1	2	4	8	16	32	64	128	256
host    256	128	64	32	16	8	4	2	1
subnet  /24	/25	/26	/27	/28	/29	/30	/31	/32

Total range: 10.0.0.0/24 => 32-24=2^8=>10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.256

		IP range		Network ID		Broadcast IP		Range
First range:    10.0.0.1-10.0.0.62	10.0.0.0		10.0.0.63		10.0.0.0/26

2nd range:      10.0.0.65-10.0.0.126	10.0.0.64		10.0.0.127		10.0.0.64/26

3rd range:      10.0.0.129-10.0.0.190	10.0.0.128		10.0.0.191		10.0.0.128/26

Create New User in Azure
-> Go to Microsoft Entra ID -> Manage -> Users
-> Click on Create New User
-> Add the username and set password
-> In the role assignments, select Add Group and add AzureGroup(gives all necessary permissions to its members)
-> Finalize and create the user
-> When logging in for the first time, you will be prompted to reset the password.

Granting access to users:
-> Go to Subscription -> MML/create new subscription if not exist -> Access Control(IAM) -> Add -> Add Role Assignment
-> New roles can be created or assigned to different users/groups

Adjusting Quotas
-> Go to Quotas -> Settings -> My Quotas
-> Check the limit for your preferred resources(Regional vCPUs, availability sets, DSv3 Family vCPUs etc)
-> We can adjust the quota according to our requirements.

Cloud Deployment Models:

-> Public: Shared resources, Minimal Investment,No setup cost,Infrastructure Management is not required, No maintenance, Dynamic Scalability
Disadvantages: Less secure, security concerns, vendor lock-in, compliance, cost management
Used for web hosting, Software development and deployment, SaaS applications.

-> Private: Better Control,Data Security and Privacy,Supports Legacy Systems,Customization,Less scalable,Costly, 

-> Hybrid: Flexibility and control,Cost,Security,Difficult to manage,Slow data transmission

**Azure Edge Zone: An Azure Edge Zone is a local extension of Azure that brings compute, storage, and networking services closer to where data is generated or consumed — often in metro areas, at telecom operator facilities, or even on customer premises. It’s designed to support low-latency and high-throughput applications, like real-time analytics, gaming, IoT, and AR/VR. Running AR/VR experiences in real time, Hosting multiplayer game logic close to gamers, Processing video feeds on-site for a smart factory, Delivering AI results within milliseconds on local machines

Key Benefits
Low Latency: Closer proximity = faster response times (often <10ms).

Data Sovereignty: Data can stay within local regions or even onsite.

Scalability: Use Azure tools to scale workloads up or down.

Consistency: Same APIs, tools, and management as global Azure.

Cloud CDN:
A Cloud CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a globally distributed network of servers that caches and delivers web content (like images, videos, CSS/JS files, or even APIs) closer to users to improve performance, reliability, and scalability. These edge servers store copies of static assets like images, videos, CSS, JavaScript files, or even full HTML pages.


Hierarchy in Azure:
Account -> subscription -> entra id -> tenant

Assignment:
VIII. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Labs:

Assign Built-in Roles at Different Scopes:

 Navigate to a Subscription, Resource Group, or a specific resource (e.g., a Storage Account).

 Assign the "Reader" role to a test user at the Subscription level.

 Verify the user can view resources in all Resource Groups within the Subscription but cannot make changes.

 Assign the "Contributor" role to the same test user at a specific Resource Group level.

 Verify the user can now create and manage resources within that specific Resource Group.

 Assign the "Storage Blob Data Reader" role to the same test user on a specific Storage Account. Verify the user can only read data from blobs in that Storage Account.

 Remove all role assignments for the test user.

 Assign "Reader" role to a user at resource group level.

 Verify the user is not getting access outside the resource group.
