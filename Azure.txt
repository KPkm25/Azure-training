Types of Scaling in Kubernetes

-> Horizontal scaling/Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): This feature can effortlessly add or release pod replicas automatically.
-> Vertical scaling/Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA): This feature in which CPU and memory reservations adjust automatically.
-> Cluster Autoscaler: In this feature an analysis of resources occurs, and we make essential adjustments in the deployment and handle the load.(similar to horizontal scaling)

PaaS - Any service that can be customizable for the user

Non-functional requirements:

Non-functional requirements in software engineering refer to the characteristics of a software system that are not related to specific functionality or behavior. They describe how the system should perform, rather than what it should do. 

Examples of NFR:
-> Availability, scalability, performance, agility, security, consistency, reliability, durability

* Strategy is a long term plan while tactics are the short term plan to achieve a certain outcome

Connecting to the Azure VM
-> Start the Cloud shell and upload the .pem file
-> Check the .pem file permissions by running the command ls -ltr
-> Change the file permission by running the cmd, "chmod 400 <pem file name>"
-> Connect to the instance via ssh using the command, "ssh -i <pem filename> <username>@<publicIP>", example: ssh -i parakram-vm01_key.pem parakram@74.224.99.200
